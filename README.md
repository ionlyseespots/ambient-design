# Ambient

[Ambient] (http://ionlyseespots.github.io/ambient-design) is a methodology for creating layout.

Our goal is to deliver a lean, lightweight semantic grid system for HTML elements, while also maintaining a separation from content that adapts across different devices.

We also extend HTML’s elements, attributes and values into design patterns to help you display your application’s UI clearly.

> Please note that Ambient requires the use of [Flexible Box Layout Module] (http://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox)

## Demo

To see Ambient in action, view grid examples: http://ionlyseespots.github.io/ambient-design/examples/grid/index.html

## Quick Start

Install with [Bower] (http://bower.io/): bower install ambient

Read the [Getting started page] (http://ionlyseespots.github.io/ambient-design/docs/index.html) for information, templates and examples.

## Development

This project is in early development.

Ambient is about using HTML to convey structure in a consistent grid system. The base grid system is a CSS3 flexbox layout that is defined by HTML5 elements. Design patterns are about defining namespaces for the HTML to live in.
It works by generating styles for elements, attributes & values. And it's the key to unlocking this new approach.

## Usage

Once you have your [starter HTML5 template](http://ionlyseespots.github.io/ambient-design/examples/starter-template/index.html) start writing HTML5.

## Background

Ambient grid system is a methodology for creating layout.

This system evolved out of the need to fully decouple markup (HTML) from presentation (CSS).

To do that, I believe markup needs to become the presentation. Or more specifically, presentation format. While presentation changes can require changes in structure, content can be changed without any need for structural change beyond the base grid system.

Ambient use of HTML5 elements & CSS3 properties to convey structure in a consistent base grid system. The base grid system is a CSS3 flexbox layout that is defined by HTML5 elements. Design patterns are about defining namespaces for the HTML to live in. It works by generating styles for elements, attributes & values. And it's the key to unlocking this new approach.
