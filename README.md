# Ambient

[Ambient] (http://ionlyseespots.github.io/ambient-design) is semantic layout.

Back to basics. Ambient is a lightweight and modular HTML5 UI development methodology. Ambient make use of HTML5 sections & outlines for semantic scaffolding and CSS3 attributes on elements for page layout.

Ambient is ready to adopt whatever your design or style is. Feel free to use HTML, whenever and wherever you like. Build the intent of your content. You can add additional layout values as well as extend child attributes to your scaffolding to gradually build a hierarchy that defines your layout.

> Please note that Ambient requires the use of [Flexible Box Layout Module] (http://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox)

## Usage

Once you have your [starter HTML5 template](http://ionlyseespots.github.io/ambient-design/examples/starter-template/index.html) linked to the Ambient CSS, start building the intent of your content.

## Background

Sometimes I have UI that plays well with a traditional grid paradigm but sometimes I need a more complex grid. This can mean learning grid classes for structure with floats, columns and media queries.

I liked reusing classes for design but I became frustrated with classes for structure that were not very clear. I wanted to get back to basics with HTML5 and create a methodology to layout the document outline. The layout should be dynamic, and fit any range of viewports.
