# Ambient

[Ambient Design] (http://ionlyseespots.github.io/ambient-design) lets you develop web applications as if you had your own personal designer inside the browser.

Our goal is to deliver a lean, lightweight base system for HTML as a presentation format that adapts across different devices.
We also extend HTML’s elements, attributes and values into design patterns to help you display your application’s UI clearly.

> Please note that using Ambient Design requires the [Flexible Box Layout Module] (http://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox)

## Quick Start

## Usage

Ambient is about HTML as a presentation format. Design patterns are about defining namespaces for the HTML to live in.
It works by generating styles for elements, attributes & values. And it's the key to unlocking this new approach.

1. Base fluid design system in a good spot.
2. Initial Form States are added.
3. Navs are the next priority.
