# Ambient Design

> Ambient design is methodology for creating layout.

* Ambient design has 2 base design patterns: landscape & portrait.
* This allows the HTML to be more fully responsive without the need for structure based classes.

<pre>
 There are 5 distinct design patterns in ambient design:

    1. Typography
    2. UI Elements
    3. UX Shells (first priority)
    "panel-shell & multi-column-shell design patterns are the first priority"
    These make up the living (static) template you see here.
    4. Navs
    5. Form States (second priority)
