# Ambient

[Ambient Design] (http://ionlyseespots.github.io/ambient-design) is a methodology for creating layout.

Our goal is to deliver a lean, lightweight base system for HTML to convey presentation format (layout), while also maintaining a separation from presentation style (design) that adapts across different devices.

We also extend HTML’s elements, attributes and values into design patterns to help you display your application’s UI clearly.

> Please note that using Ambient Design requires the use of [Flexible Box Layout Module] (http://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox)

## Demo

To see Ambient in action and get started, check out http://ionlyseespots.github.io/ambient-design

## Quick Start

Install with [Bower] (http://bower.io/): bower install ambient

Read the [Getting started page] (http://ionlyseespots.github.io/ambient-design/docs/index.html) for information, templates and examples.

## Development

This project is in early development.
Ambient is about HTML as a presentation format. Design patterns are about defining namespaces for the HTML to live in.
It works by generating styles for elements, attributes & values. And it's the key to unlocking this new approach.

1. Base fluid design system for HTML5 section elements added.
2. Initial Form States added.
3. Navs are the next priority.

## Usage

Once you have your [starter HTML5 template](http://ionlyseespots.github.io/ambient-design/examples/starter-template/index.html) start writing HTML5.

## Background

Ambient design is a methodology for creating layout.

This system evolved out of the need to fully decouple markup (HTML) from presentation (CSS). To do that, I believe markup (HTML) needs to become the presentation format.
