# Ambient Design

> Ambient design is methodology for creating layout.

<pre>
    Ambient design has 2 core patterns: landscape & portrait, allowing the HTML to be more fully responsive without the need for structure based classes.

 There are five distinct patterns in ambient design:

    Typography
    UI Elements
    UX Shells (first priority)
    admin-shell, panel-shell and multi-column-shell design patterns are the first priority, and make up the living (static) template you see here.
    Navs
    Form States (second priority)
