# Ambient

[Ambient] (http://ionlyseespots.github.io/ambient-design) is semantic layout.

Back to basics. Ambient is a lightweight and modular HTML5 UI development methodology. Ambient makes use of HTML5 elements & CSS3 properties to layout semantic markup.

Ambient is ready to adopt whatever your design or style is. Feel free to use semantic HTML5 tags, whenever and wherever you like. HTML5 sections and outlines within Ambient define themselves, creating a visual structure for the document outline.

> Please note that Ambient requires the use of [Flexible Box Layout Module] (http://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox)

## Development

This project is in early development.

Ambient layout makes use of HTML5 elements & CSS3 properties to layout semantic markup. Ambient UI patterns are layout-related attributes for content.

## Usage

Once you have your [starter HTML5 template](http://ionlyseespots.github.io/ambient-design/examples/starter-template/index.html) start writing HTML5.

## Background

Sometimes I have UI that plays well with a traditional (4, 6, 8, and 12 column) grid paradigm but sometimes I need a more complex grid. This can mean learning grid classes for structure with floats, columns and media queries.

I liked reusing classes for design. Other times I became frustrated reusing classes for structure that were not very clear. I wanted to get back to basics with HTML5 and create a methodology for layout for the unpredictable. The layout should be dynamic, and fit any range of viewports. 

This system evolved out of the need to fully decouple markup (HTML) from presentation (CSS).

While presentation changes can require changes in structure, content can be changed without any need for structural change beyond the semantic layout.
