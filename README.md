 There are 5 distinct design patterns in ambient design:

    1. Typography
    2. UI Elements
    3. UX Shells (first priority)
    "panel-shell & multi-column-shell design patterns are the first priority"
    These make up the living (static) template you see here.
    4. Navs
    5. Form States (second priority)
